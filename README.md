Mitsuba 2 is a research-oriented rendering system written in portable C++17. It
consists of a small set of core libraries and a wide variety of plugins that
implement functionality ranging from materials and light sources to complete
rendering algorithms. Mitsuba 2 strives to retain scene compatibility with its
predecessor [Mitsuba 0.6](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba).
However, in most other respects, it is a completely new system following a
different set of goals.

## Compiling and using Mitsuba 2

Please see the [documentation](http://mitsuba2.readthedocs.org/en/latest) for
details on how to compile, use, and extend Mitsuba 2.

## About

This project was created by [Vincent Versnel] for his master thesis on efficient raytracing of multiply scattered light through non-linear media.
